A Lab site and Blog for documenting and testing my work with BSD, Python, CSS, and HTML. This site is also for the PyBUG user group (Python BSD users group) so we can collaborate and share notes. A docs folder has been created to house tutorials for the community to collaborate on. The first doc in there is the Intro to FreeBSD Workshop adapted from the Getting Started with FreeBSD Workshop presented at SCaLE 17x in Pasadena, CA and updated for the SCaLE 18x conference. You can read it at the following URL: [Intro to FreeBSD Workshop](https://github.com/possnfiffer/bsd-pw/blob/gh-pages/docs/Intro_to_FreeBSD_Workshop.md)
